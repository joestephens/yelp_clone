User Stories

Visitors can create new restaurants using a form, specifying a name and description
Restaurants can be edited and deleted

Visitors can leave reviews for restaurants, providing a numerical score (1-5) and a comment about their experience

The restaurants listings page should display all the reviews, along with the average rating of each restaurant

Validations should be in place for the restaurant and review forms - restaurants must be given a name and rating, reviews must be given a rating from 1-5 (comment is optional)
